# EOXS Automation API - Railway Deployment

This is a REST API wrapper around the EOXS Playwright automation script, designed to be deployed on Railway.

## üöÄ Quick Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Prepare Repository
1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Upload all these files to the repository
3. Commit and push to GitHub

### Step 2: Deploy on Railway
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway will auto-detect the Dockerfile and deploy

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, go to your project ‚Üí Variables tab and add:

```
EOXS_EMAIL=sahajkatiyareoxs@gmail.com
EOXS_PASSWORD=Eoxs12345!
NODE_ENV=production
HEADLESS=true
```

### Step 4: Get Your API Endpoint
After deployment, Railway will provide a URL like:
```
https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
```

## üì° API Endpoints

### 1. Health Check
```bash
GET https://your-app.up.railway.app/health
```

### 2. Create Single Ticket
```bash
POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/create-ticket
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "subject": "Login Issues - Cannot Access Dashboard",
  "customer": "Discount Pipe & Steel",
  "body": "Hi Support Team, I'm having trouble logging into my account...",
  "assignedTo": "Sahaj Katiyar"
}
```

### 3. Create Multiple Tickets (Batch)
```bash
POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/create-tickets-batch
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tickets": [
    {
      "subject": "Login Issues",
      "customer": "Discount Pipe & Steel",
      "body": "Cannot access dashboard"

export EOXS_PASSWORD="your-password"
export HEADLESS=true
```

4. Start server:
```bash
npm start
```

5. Test endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/create-ticket \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"subject": "Test Ticket", "customer": "Discount Pipe & Steel", "body": "Test body"}'
```
